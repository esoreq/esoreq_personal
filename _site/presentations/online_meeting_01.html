Introduce yourself effectively
-->

# Welcome to 
## Artificial Intelligence & Intelligent Systems

First thing on the agenda is to talk about is the course name... 
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

----

<!-- .slide: id="red-slide"  -->
<!-- .slide: data-background="#ffffff" data-transition="zoom" -->
# introduction to
# neuroCognitive data science



----

<!-- .slide: data-transition="fade-in slide-out" -->

# Who am I? 
Note:
My name is Dr Eyal Soreq,
And I am interested in understanding the link between perception and action
Specifically how visual manipulation prime goal related complex behaviour 
I study this using cognitive games that we develop and many different 
experimental measures, including fMRI and EEG 


----
<!-- .slide: data-transition="fade" -->
# Who are you?

I would like you now to introduce yourself briefly in the same manner.
### Your name 
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" style="text-align:left;padding-left: 20vmin;" -->
### Your **current** broad interest
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" style="text-align:left;padding-left: 20vmin;"-->
### Any previous research experience
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" style="text-align:left;padding-left: 20vmin;"-->

# What is my background?

Note:
So I am currently a post-doc at the brain department at imperial college london
But my background goes back to my army days... 
You might not know but military service is mandatory for all 
Israeli citizens over the age of 18 [P]
I was fortunate enough to get assigned to the intelligence core where I served as an officer in charge of developing tools to investigate satellite imagery [P]
After I finished my mandatory service I enrolled in a Math and Philosophy BA in Uni [P]
However after a year I was called back to service for a couple of months after which I needed to do some thing completely different [P]
So I went and studied animation for four years in the high academy of art... [P]
Later on I got an academic position in the same Art academy [P]
Where I taught for 11 years seven of which I was the head of the computer animation program which I developed. [P]
During that time I became fascinated with human perception and the link to human behaviour [P]
This led me to enroll in a masters in psychobiology in Tel-aviv university during which I explored the link between reward mechanisms and digital interaction, [P]
I Was also part of an EEG BCI development team. [P]
And created new ways to investigate functional networks using fMRI data. [P]
I received my computational cognitive neuroscience PhD 
from the brain department at imperial college london 
where I examined working memory and human intelligence using fMRI functional data. 
And I said before I am now a post-doc at the same lab doing both large scale behavioural analysis from huge online interaction data-sets [P]
as well as continuing to use and develop ways to apply data science tools to improve our understanding on the link between the brain and human behaviour.

# what are your
# expectations from the course?


----
<!-- .slide: data-transition="convex" -->
# What is the plan? 

- Use real messy data!!! 
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->
- Provide you with applied knowledge of central methods in modern data science
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- How to use analytical tools to address neurocognitive questions
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- How to use Python and research notebooks to make your research reproducible
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- How to use Data visualization to explore, interpret and communicate your findings
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

----
<!-- .slide: data-transition="concave" -->

# If we have time... 

- How to use parallel processing (using the cluster)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- To investigate complex multi-dimensional brain related data
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

----
# Benefiting The Most From The Course

- Self-motivation and discipline are key
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- You are responsible for maintaining a regular study system
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Collaborate And Share Ideas, Code, Examples Etc.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- Ask Questions!
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

---- 
# Weekly assignments

- This course is a flipped course...
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Weekly assignments are included in the online self-paced material
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Assignments are due on Sunday Morning
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- Assignments are a stepping stone to more complex parts to follow.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

# Feedback
<a href="#/red-slide">Link</a>

- This course is a pilot 
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- This means that the weekly material is created to adapt to your capabilities...
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Please give feedback on how to improve the course
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- I like compliments, but I would also like honest ideas for improvement
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

# Any Questions ? 

-s-

# Why Python?  

----

# Python is simple and flexible

- It is simple to write 
- But more importantly it is simple to read

----

# Python is general 
## It can be used for: 
- Data science (obviously..)
- App development
- Robotics 
- and much much more

----

# Python has a huge community

----

# Python is constantly improving

----

# Jupyter...

- You can use IDE (Pycharm, pyspider etc.)
- You can use code editors (Visual studio Code, Atom etc.)
- You can use text editors (emacs, vim etc.)
- Or you can use notebooks (Jupyter, Google Colab etc.)

----

# Which data will we use?

----

# Can we work in pairs?

----

# Why are there assignments?
