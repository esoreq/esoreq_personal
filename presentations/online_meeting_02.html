# Yes there is a reproducibility crisis!

- 52% of researchers think there is a significant reproducibility crisis
- 70% of scientists have tried but failed to reproduce another scientist’s experiments

---- 
# RULE #1
## FOR EVERY RESULT, KEEP TRACK OF HOW IT WAS PRODUCED

Knowing how you went from the raw data to the conclusion allows you to:

- defend the results
- update the results if errors are found
- reproduce the results when data is updated

----

# RULE #2
## AVOID MANUAL DATA MANIPULATION STEPS

- Sometimes it is far easier to open data files in an editor (did anyone say excel?) and manually clean up a couple of formatting errors or remove an outlier. 
- It si also easy to cut and paste between applications. 
- This temptation to use manual work instead of scripting should be resisted. 
- Manual data manipulation is hidden manipulation.

# RULE #4
## VERSION CONTROL ALL CUSTOM SCRIPTS

- A version control system, (e.g. Git), should be used to track the evolution of your code.

</div>

----

#  RULE #5
## RECORD ALL INTERMEDIATE RESULTS, WHEN POSSIBLE IN STANDARDIZED FORMATS
- In principle, as long as you kept raw data, all intermediate steps can also be recreated
- In practice, intermediate results are useful at least at the exploratory stage of the analysis.

----

# RULE #6
## FOR ANALYSES THAT INCLUDE RANDOMNESS, NOTE UNDERLYING RANDOM SEEDS

- Almost all machine learning algorithms have some stochastic element 
- This is also central for non parametric analysis 
- Even if your robust results are statistically reproducible, being able to reproduce the exact numbers produced by someone else - is key.

----
# RULE #7 
## ALWAYS STORE RAW DATA BEHIND PLOTS

- Automatically generate plots using code!!!
- Figures will constantly change up until you present results.
- If raw data is accessible, you can just change how you communicate it instead of what you communicate.
- This is also a good habit to have when working with someone else

----
# RULE #8
## GENERATE HIERARCHICAL ANALYSIS OUTPUT, ALLOWING LAYERS OF INCREASING DETAIL TO BE INSPECTED

- As scientists, our goal is to summarize results in some form. 
- That is a key step in communicating results. 
- However, summarizing data involves losing information 
- It is also an easy way to misuse data 
- For each summary result, have a link to the data used to calculate the summary.

----
# RULE #9
## CONNECT TEXTUAL STATEMENTS TO UNDERLYING RESULTS

- Data analysis results are commonly presented as a report containing words and images.
- The link between analysis and interpretations is not always straight forward. 
- Therefore it’s essential that the report of a study be linked back to the results. 
- And because of Rule #1, all the way back to the raw data.
- This can be achieved, by using...

</div>
----
# RULE #10
## PROVIDE PUBLIC ACCESS TO SCRIPTS, RUNS, AND RESULTS

- Open version control systems, such as GitLab and GitHub, allow the creation of both private and public repositories 
- Private repositories can be accessed by authorized colleagues.
- public repositories can be accessed by anyone with a computer.
- More eyes on your analysis leads to less mistakes 
- So the more you share, the better your analyses are likely to be.

# Took me a lot more than five hours to complete

- So I think the more technical weeks will take more time to complete 
- However, everything should be viewed in context of you previous expertise 
- Also, not every step is important to understand completely now, the reason I share the material with you (and add slide numbers) is that you give me feedback on slides that were difficult to understand.
- However, honestly, I did assumed you had more background 

----
# indicate at which terminal 
# (computer, juyputer hub) to used

- Good idea, next week all is Juyputer
- And for future I will try to remember to do 

----
# could you include output produced by certain code lines, so i know i did it correctly.

- Good suggestion, I think I do this in the next week's material

----
# I'm a complete beginner ... and I don't think I've understood one step

- I just don't think you were prepared for the scale of idiot you were dealing with!
- So after talking with Sam, we agreed to offer a hand on session on a different day
- Thursday afternoon is an option from my side

----
# hand on session
- Only for those struggling!!
- You need to post questions and problems in advance on the forum 

----
# Windows machine 
- Most of the course will use the web interface 
- However if you are using Windows OS I posted a detailed response to Caedyn on the class forum 

----
# bad internet connection

- The course material is all online in an open repository in GitHub 
- Also Jupyter can be installed locally 
- The data can be also rsynced locally 


----
# Permission problems with files 

- Pietro and Nina
- You need to chmod your folder in a recursive way 
```
chmod -R 750 <folder> 
```
