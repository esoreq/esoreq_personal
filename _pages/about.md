I'm currently working as a data scientist at the UKDRI CRT at Imperial College London, in the behavioral and cognitive lab. Basically, I am developing ways to objectively monitor the changes in behavior caused by neurodegenerative  conditions. 
In my research so far, I've explored sleep disturbances and UTI and how they affect dementia patients. Furthermore, I have developed a small ingestion framework that allows me and my colleagues in the CRT to work with near real-time data collected by the ongoing Minder project.
 
My research on sleep disturbances is currently working towards developing different behavioural metrics to produce transparent and interpretable means for understanding sleep-wake behavior on an individual level. This project involves monitoring dementia patients over an extended period (almost two years) using various passive and active IoT sensors, and relating that to models to better understand and monitor sleep patterns. Currently I'm working on a paper using data-driven approaches to examine the sleep habits of our volunteers living with dementia in 60 different homes over the course of 20k nights.


Previously, I conducted research on the link between form and function in the brain relating to cognitive abilities (primarily working memory and intelligence).

In my free time I like to read, run, cook, raise four amazing kids and play tabletop games.
